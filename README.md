This was a simple Python2 script to batch convert video files.

This was not completed as it was simple enough to use ffmpeg or mencoder along with forfiles on Windows or find and xargs on nonix to automate batch encoding along with appropriate regex.

I have kept this here for reference of earlier attempts at Python code.
